   cd thapar-pg-assistant
2. Install Dependencies:
   ``` bash
   pip install chromadb
   pip install dotenv
   pip install huggingface_hub
   pip install sentence_transformers
3. Data Preparation 
   Convert all the .xlsx file into .txt file
4. Format each file with delimiters like ###
5. Usage 
   ```python
   from assistant import ThaparAssistant
   assistant = ThaparAssistant()
   Query examples
   queries = [
    "What are hostel fees for 2-sharing rooms?",
    "Which societies are best for coders?",
    "Tell me about MSc scholarships"
    ]
    for query in queries:
        print(f"Q: {query}")
        print(f"A: {assistant.ask(query)}\n")
6. Limitations
   1. Requires accurate source data formatting
   2. Falcon-7B may hallucinate without strict prompting
   3. ChromaDB collections need manual reset for data updates

7. TroubleShooting
   - Problem : Hallucinated answers
   - Solution : Strengthen Prompt Constraints
   ```python
   def build_prompt(self, query, context):
    return f"""Answer ONLY using:
    {context}
    Rules:
    1. Never invent numbers
    2. Use only Rs for currency
    3. If unsure, say "Not in records"
    Answer:"""
